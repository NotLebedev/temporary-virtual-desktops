# Temporary Virtual Desktops

This is a script that automatically adds and removes virtual desktops.
That's a feature known from the GNOME Shell, and while it works best with its unmatched overview mode, that feature can be also useful when using KDE Plasma.

Functionality: 
* Once a virtual desktop becomes empty (no normal windows on this desktop), it'll be removed, unless it's the only virtual desktop left.
* You can configure some additional behavior in script's configuration, e.g. always keeping a spare (empty) virtual desktop.
